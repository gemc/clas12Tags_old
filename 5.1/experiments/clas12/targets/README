CLAS12 TARGETS README

--------------------------------------------------

There are two variations of the LH2 target.
"original", that has a simple model of the cell and scattering chambers
"elaborate", that produces a target according to drawings


In MYSQL mode, before building the geometry one must
upload the parameters onto the DB.

The commands to build the geometry, banks, hit defs
and materials are:

upload_parameters.pl config.dat   < only for MYSQL factory

./targets.pl config.dat




# Experiments:


## RGF: Sept 22 2022

Author: Yu-Chun Hung

Experiment Description: Measure the structure function F2 of the neutron by tagging the spectator proton in the RTPC detector. Deuterium, hydrogen, and helium gas are used at 5.6 atm pressure.

### Variations: bonusD2, bounsH2, bonusHe

### Files used: 

### How to use it in the gcard
1. Set up the target with bonusD2 variations:
<detector name="experiments/clas12/targets/target" factory="TEXT" variation="bonusD2"/>
2. Shift the target position by 30 mm
<detector name="target">    <position x="0*cm"  y="0*cm"  z="-3.00*cm"  />  </detector>


## RGM: Sept 20 2022

Author: Justin Estee

Experiment Description: Short Range Correlations & Electrons for Neutrinos experiment 


### Variations: 
Liquid Targets (Standard 5cm liquid cell)
lH2 - liquid Hydrogen
lD2 - liquid Deuterium
lHe - liquid Helium

Solid Targets
RGM_2_C - single foil carbon target in beamline
RGM_2_Sn - single foil tin target in beamline

RGM_8_C_L - 4-foil carbon target in beamline. Large carbon target option.
RGM_8_Sn_L - 4-foil tin target in beamline. Large tin target option.

RGM_8_C_S - 4-foil carbon target in beamline. Small carbon target option.
RGM_8_Sn_S - 4-foil tin target in beamline. Small tin target option.

RGM_Ca - Calcium target cell

Scattering chamber variations
cad - standard scattering chamber and liquid cell target wall entrance and exit material
cadrgm - standard scattering chamber without liquid cell wall and upstream window, only downstream window and pipe included (use with solid targets)
### Files used


### How to use it in the gcard
Liquid Targets
Use "cad" variation with all liquid targets
<detector name="experiments/clas12/targets/cad/"   factory="CAD"/>
<detector name="experiments/clas12/targets/target" factory="TEXT" variation="lD2"/>

Solid Targets
Use "cadrgm" variation with all solid targets
<detector name="experiments/clas12/targets/cadrgm/"   factory="CAD"/>
<detector name="experiments/clas12/targets/target" factory="TEXT" variation="RGM_2_C"/>
