# clas12tags for 4a.2.4 and up
#
# This Dockerfile describes the clas12tags gemc containers for JLAB_VERSION 2.2 versions:
# 4a.2.4
#
# It relies on the jlabce base image for CLHEP, GEANT4, and ROOT as well as several system
# packages. This is based on David Lawrence docker builds in 	https://gitlab.com/ESC/containers.git
#
# This will create a docker image that includes both a noVNC-webserver
# and VNC-server that can be used to view graphics on the host using
# either a native webrowser (HTML5 enabled) or a native VNC viewer. This
# includes the ability to view OpenGL graphics.
#
# The graphics support was originally inspired by the Docker-opengl project
# here:
#
#  https://github.com/thewtex/docker-opengl
#
# In the end, the only thing used from that was the idea to use
# noVNC. Thus, we do not include their license. However, I do want to give
# them credit for inspiring this work.
#
#  The container should be run with the "-p 6080:6080" option to allow
# outside connections to see the webserver. To connect to the VNC
# server directly, you should add the "-p 5900:5900" option. (Both
# can be included if you like.) Once inside the container, run "xstart"
# to fire up the servers. Then follow the directions for connecting.
#

#
# Remember to find/replace the <tag> and JLAB_VERSION with the newest one
# Remember to match clas12tags and JLAB_VERSION in environment.csh
#
#   docker build -f Dockerfile-4a.2.4 -t clas12tags:4a.2.4 .

#   docker tag clas12tags:4a.2.4 jeffersonlab/clas12tags:4a.2.4
#
#   docker push jeffersonlab/clas12tags:4a.2.4

# To run in batch mode:
